* CMake Boost.System Test

This is a simple example for my CMake modularization of boost. It uses =Boost.System= and all of its dependencies.

* Run

To test the example on a *nix system (like Linux or Mac OSX), open a shell and run the following commands.

#+begin_src sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/elzair/cmake-boost-system-test.git
cd cmake-boost-system-test
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./test_system
#+end_src sh
